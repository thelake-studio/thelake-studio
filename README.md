# 🌊 The Lake Studio

**Human technology, thoughtful design, meaningful solutions.**

Hi there — I'm **José Luis Lázaro**, a designer and creative technologist based in Spain.
I founded **The Lake Studio**, a small independent space where design, technology, and reflection meet to create solutions that are useful, beautiful, and human.

### 🧭 What The Lake Studio stands for
At The Lake Studio, everything begins with empathy and purpose.
We believe that technology should serve people — not the other way around.

Our approach is built on three principles:
- **Think** — Understand real needs with clarity and intention.
- **Learn** — Stay curious, humble, and open to everything.
- **Solve** — Craft simple, meaningful solutions that make a difference.

### 💡 What’s coming next
This GitHub will soon become a place to explore ideas, prototypes, and projects that connect design and technology in a human way.
For now, you can learn more about The Lake Studio and its philosophy on our website *(coming soon)* or follow the journey through design and reflection.
